At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,10.0,10) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (30,30.0,30) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 60.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (37,42.7,45) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 40.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,20.0,10) frames.
Overall, appa accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (46,46.0,46) frames.
Overall, miss accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (45,45.0,45) frames.
Overall, vanthirukaanga accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (37,37.0,37) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 23.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 76.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
