At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,25.0,25) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (43,43.0,43) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 62.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,30.8,44) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 37.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,25.0,25) frames.
Overall, enakkeu accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (44,44.0,44) frames.
Overall, innoorxeuwaatxtxisollungga accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (38,38.0,38) frames.
Overall, ndiinggasolrxadupuriyala accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
Overall, poodxeungga accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, weerxadxres accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (59,59.0,59) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 32.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 70.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 16.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,7.0,7)
