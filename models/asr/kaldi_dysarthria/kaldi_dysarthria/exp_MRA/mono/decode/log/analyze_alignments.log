At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (33,33.0,33) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (21,21.0,21) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 72.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,20.0,31) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 27.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,22.3,21) frames.
Overall, aalukka accounts for 18.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,21.0,12) frames.
Overall, oruoru accounts for 18.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,24.0,15) frames.
Overall, tharen accounts for 18.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,18.0,5) frames.
Overall, waitpanunga accounts for 18.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,17.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 29.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 76.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 7.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 11.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,13.0,13)
