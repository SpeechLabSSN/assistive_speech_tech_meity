The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 38.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 65.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 5.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.1 hours of data, or 0.7 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 11.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (23,24.1,88)
