At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (100,100.0,100) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (88,98.0,88) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 50.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,62.0,24) frames.
Overall, ellaa accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (108,108.0,108) frames.
Overall, kraikttairukkeu accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (88,88.0,88) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 38.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 61.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
