At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,27.0,27) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (91,91.0,91) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 57.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,69.2,67) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 42.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,40.3,27) frames.
Overall, irunggaammaa accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,50.5,34) frames.
Overall, kanxakkeupootxtxeusolwaangga accounts for 28.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,88.0,9) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 30.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 70.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 1.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 20.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (3,3.0,3)
