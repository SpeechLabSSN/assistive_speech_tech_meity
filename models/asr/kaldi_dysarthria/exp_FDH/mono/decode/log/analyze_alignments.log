Overall, S18 accounts for 0.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (85,76.6,86) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 73.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 40.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 34.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.4 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 33.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (53,60.0,144)
