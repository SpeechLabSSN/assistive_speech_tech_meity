The optional-silence phone sil occupies 28.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 81.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 12.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 18.7 hours of data, or 13.4 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 6.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (17,19.5,41)
