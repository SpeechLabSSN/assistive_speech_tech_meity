The optional-silence phone sil occupies 23.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 82.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 8.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 12.7 hours of data, or 9.7 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,16.1,37)
