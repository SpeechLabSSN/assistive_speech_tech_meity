The optional-silence phone sil occupies 24.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 82.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 9.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 12.8 hours of data, or 9.6 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 4.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,17.9,38)
